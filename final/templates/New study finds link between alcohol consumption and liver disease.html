	<h2>New study finds link between alcohol consumption and liver disease</h2>
	<p>A new study has found a strong link between alcohol consumption and liver disease. The study, published in the Journal of Hepatology, followed 10,000 participants over a period of 10 years.</p>
	<p>The study found that participants who consumed more than 14 units of alcohol per week were at a significantly higher risk of developing liver disease. The risk increased even more for participants who consumed more than 35 units of alcohol per week.</p>
	<p>The study also found that the type of alcohol consumed did not have a significant impact on the risk of developing liver disease. Both beer and wine were found to have similar effects.</p>
	<p>This study adds to a growing body of evidence linking alcohol consumption to liver disease. It highlights the importance of moderate alcohol consumption and the potential risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
	
<h2>How Alcohol Affects the Liver</h2>
<p>Alcohol is processed in the liver, and excessive alcohol consumption can cause damage to liver cells. Over time, this can lead to inflammation and scarring of the liver, which can ultimately result in liver disease.</p>
<p>When the liver is damaged, it can no longer perform its vital functions, such as filtering toxins from the blood and producing bile to aid in digestion. This can lead to a range of health problems, including jaundice, ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen), and hepatic encephalopathy (a buildup of toxins in the brain).</p>
<p>If you're concerned about your alcohol consumption and its impact on your liver health, it's important to speak to your doctor. They can help you assess your risk of developing liver disease and provide guidance on how to reduce your risk.</p>
