			<p>Fatty and fried foods can be difficult for the liver to process and can contribute to liver damage. Parents should limit or avoid these types of foods in their child's diet.</p>
			<p>Lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, and legumes can provide the necessary nutrients without overloading the liver.</p>

			<p>Processed foods are often high in unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar, which can contribute to liver damage. Parents should limit or avoid these types of foods in their child's diet.</p>
			<p>Staying hydrated can help the liver flush out toxins and waste products. Parents should encourage their child to drink plenty of water and other fluids.</p>
			<p>Alcohol and other harmful substances can cause liver damage in children. Parents should educate their child about the dangers of these substances and avoid exposing them to them.</p>
