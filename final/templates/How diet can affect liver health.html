			<h2>How Diet Affects Liver Health</h2>
			<p>There are several ways in which diet can affect liver health. One of the most important factors is the amount of fat in your diet. Consuming a high-fat diet can lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can eventually progress to liver cirrhosis or even liver cancer.</p>
			<p>Another factor is the amount of sugar in your diet. Consuming too much sugar can cause the liver to produce more fat, which can lead to the development of fatty liver disease.</p>
			<p>It is also important to consume enough protein in your diet. Protein helps to repair liver cells and prevent liver damage.</p>
